Why Eat Fresh ?

Generally Students and Bachelors who get relocated from their hometown for work or study related purposes, These people usually face a lot of problems  acquiring  daily food which is of good quality , that's healthy and hygienic and also pocket friendly at the same time so that one can gave that everyday of the month as their staple, usually managing food becomes a big challenge for this people , In fact a lot of them fall sick because of irregular food habits that people develop when they live outside of home, The only way to solve this is if people like this found a source a good food that's like home cooked food which is good for the health and also something reasonable that can be afforded 2 times a day everyday, So we came up with the idea of having a meal service plan app where we provide our users various food plans to choose from depending upon their needs, The basic idea is to provide good and hygienic food at a reasonable(affordable) rate.
